- 👋 Hi, I’m Wilma.
- 👀 I’m interested in the future of secure embedded systems design and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better leader, which starts with being a better follower!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to making the world's code secure, small, low-power, memory-efficient, and fast! I'm an architect at heart and I work best with people who are as enthusiastic about working with people who are eager to learn and take things apart to figure out how they work.
- 📫 How to reach me: williamwhitacre0@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Zhe/Zir/Any
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've played fingerstyle guitar since the age of five and it was my first true love.
